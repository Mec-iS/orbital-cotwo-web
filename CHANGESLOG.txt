** Version 0.0.1 (actual)
- round() coordinates floats to 6th digit [DONE]
(1) use only latest data:
--1a download nc4 files reversed [DONE]
--1b use a UNIQUE constraint on the couple (lat, long), do not consider timestamp [DONE][DEPRECATED]
(2) use SQLite [DONE] [DEPRECATED]
(3) API: only Area of Interest endpoint (the client passes to the server the center of its map and the zoom level)
(6) Use a blocking server (Falcon Framework)


** Version 0.0.5
--1b a UNIQUE constraint implemented for (timestamp, coordinates) [DONE]
2 use PostGIS 2.0 (probably this should be anticipated to avoid heavy refactor soon) [DONE]
(4) store earth/water flag and altitude
3 API: AoI and zoom level for granularity of data (higher zoom level, more points)



** version 1.0
(5) store previous data (archive):
-- 1b use a UNIQUE constraint on (lat, long, timestamp) [DONE] [DEPRECATED]
3 API: add timestamp selection for the client (last 6 months, 6to12 months, 12to18 months,...)
